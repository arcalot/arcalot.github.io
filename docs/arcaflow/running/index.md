# Running Arcaflow

Running Arcaflow is simple! You will need three things:

1. A local container engine (e.g. Docker or Podman)
2. The [Arcaflow Engine](https://github.com/arcalot/arcaflow-engine/releases)
3. A workflow file (see the [example workflows](https://github.com/arcalot/arcaflow-workflows))

Please start by [setting up Arcaflow](setup.md).
